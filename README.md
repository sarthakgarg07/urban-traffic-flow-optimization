# Urban Traffic Flow Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize traffic flow in an urban area using graph algorithms. By representing the city as a graph with intersections as nodes and roads as edges, various algorithms are applied to find the most efficient routes, reduce congestion, and improve overall traffic management.

## Features
- Graph representation of the city with nodes (intersections) and edges (roads).
- Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation.
- Integration of real-time traffic data to update edge weights dynamically.
- Simple web interface for users to input origin and destination and see the optimal path.
